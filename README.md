# MindPlus-Workshop
Unity project created to demonstrate some basic VR capabilities of the engine during the MindPlus workshop.

The MindPlus VR Workshop was held on the 17th of January, 2023. We ended up making a game about shooting chickens and minions and exploding Among Us characters. 
One of the students suggested the suitable name "Minions, Chick Chick Boom! Among Us". Created with Unity version 2021.3.6f1
